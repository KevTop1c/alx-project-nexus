## 📘 1. Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is an intensive, hands-on training designed to help developers build strong foundations in **server-side application development**.  
It combines theory, mentorship, and project-based learning to equip participants with the skills needed to design, build, and deploy scalable backend systems.

Through the program, I gained practical experience in:

- Building robust and secure APIs
- Managing databases and optimizing data access
- Deploying applications with Docker and CI/CD pipelines
- Applying software design principles and performance optimization strategies

The program emphasized not only **technical mastery** but also **collaboration**, **code quality**, and **problem-solving under real-world constraints**.
